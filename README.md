bytes to your buddy's browser with no external webserver at all

yeah i mean i never got this to work and just gave up and decided to have a web server do the signaling for me ...
(i mean c'mon, gotta have one to host your files for you, right?)
woulda been cool, though!

EDIT: it does work between two browser tabs, for what that's worth. it's across the network that issues crop up; mozilla remote clients seem to get an error about needing a STUN server.

perhaps revisiting this after having set up a proper signaling server will shed some light on what's going wrong here.
